# Training Load Interpretation Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting training load metrics calculated by TrainRS.

## Overview

Training load metrics provide quantifiable insights into training stress, adaptation, and recovery. This guide explains how to interpret and apply these metrics for optimal training outcomes.

## Core Metrics Interpretation

### Training Stress Score (TSS)

TSS quantifies the overall training stress of a workout by combining intensity and duration.

#### Interpretation Ranges

| TSS Range | Workout Intensity | Recovery Time | Examples |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| < 150 | Low stress | < 24 hours | Easy ride, recovery run |
| 150-300 | Moderate stress | 24-48 hours | Tempo workout, moderate ride |
| 300-450 | High stress | 48-72 hours | Threshold intervals, long ride |
| > 450 | Very high stress | > 72 hours | Race, epic ride, hard stage |

#### Practical Applications

**Session Planning:**
```
Target TSS based on training goals:
- Recovery days: 50-100 TSS
- Base training: 100-200 TSS
- Threshold work: 200-350 TSS
- VO2 max intervals: 150-250 TSS
- Race simulation: 300+ TSS
```

**Weekly Distribution:**
```
Typical weekly TSS distribution:
- Monday: 100 TSS (recovery)
- Tuesday: 250 TSS (intervals)
- Wednesday: 150 TSS (endurance)
- Thursday: 200 TSS (tempo)
- Friday: 75 TSS (easy)
- Saturday: 350 TSS (long ride)
- Sunday: 125 TSS (easy spin)
Total: ~1250 TSS/week
```

### Intensity Factor (IF)

IF represents the relative intensity of a workout compared to your threshold.

#### Interpretation Guidelines

| IF Range | Intensity Zone | Sustainable Duration | Training Focus |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| < 0.75 | Recovery/Aerobic | > 4 hours | Base building, recovery |
| 0.75-0.85 | Tempo | 2-4 hours | Aerobic power, fat oxidation |
| 0.85-0.95 | Threshold | 1-2 hours | Lactate threshold, racing |
| 0.95-1.05 | VO2 max | 8-40 minutes | Maximal aerobic power |
| > 1.05 | Anaerobic | < 8 minutes | Neuromuscular power |

#### Training Applications

**Workout Validation:**
- **IF too high**: Workout may be unsustainable, check pacing
- **IF too low**: May not achieve desired training stimulus
- **IF variable**: Check for equipment issues or pacing problems

**Race Pacing:**
```
Target IF for different race durations:
- Time trial (1 hour): IF 0.95-1.00
- Road race (3-4 hours): IF 0.85-0.90
- Gran fondo (5-6 hours): IF 0.75-0.80
- Ultra-endurance (8+ hours): IF 0.65-0.75
```

### Normalized Power (NP)

NP accounts for the non-linear physiological response to variable power output.

#### Key Insights

**NP vs Average Power:**
- **NP > Average**: Variable intensity workout
- **NP ≈ Average**: Steady-state effort
- **High variability**: Inefficient pacing or interval workout

**Training Applications:**
- **Group rides**: NP reflects actual physiological cost
- **Criteriums**: High NP due to surges and accelerations
- **Time trials**: NP should closely match average power

## Performance Management Chart (PMC)

The PMC tracks the dynamic balance between fitness and fatigue over time.

### Chronic Training Load (CTL) - Fitness

CTL represents your training capacity and fitness level.

#### Interpretation

| CTL Level | Fitness Description | Typical Athlete |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| < 40 | Beginner/Detrained | Recreational cyclist |
| 40-60 | Recreational | Regular weekend rider |
| 60-80 | Trained | Competitive amateur |
| 80-100 | Well-trained | Cat 2/3 racer |
| > 100 | Elite | Professional/Cat 1 |

#### CTL Management

**Building Phase:**
- Increase CTL by 3-7 points per week
- Monitor for signs of overreaching
- Plan recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks

**Maintenance Phase:**
- Maintain CTL within ±5 points
- Focus on intensity over volume
- Reduce training stress if needed

**Taper Phase:**
- Reduce CTL by 10-20% over 2-3 weeks
- Maintain intensity, reduce volume
- Time peak for key events

### Acute Training Load (ATL) - Fatigue

ATL represents recent training stress and fatigue.

#### Interpretation Patterns

**ATL Trends:**
- **Rising ATL**: Accumulating fatigue, monitor recovery
- **Stable ATL**: Balanced training load
- **Falling ATL**: Recovering or detraining

**ATL/CTL Ratio:**
- **Ratio > 1.3**: High fatigue state, prioritize recovery
- **Ratio 1.0-1.3**: Moderate fatigue, sustainable
- **Ratio < 1.0**: Low fatigue, can handle more stress

### Training Stress Balance (TSB) - Form

TSB indicates readiness to perform or absorb additional training.

#### TSB Zones

| TSB Range | Form Status | Training Recommendation | Performance Expectation |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| > +25 | Very fresh | High-intensity work possible | Peak performance possible |
| +10 to +25 | Fresh | Moderate to high intensity | Good performance |
| -10 to +10 | Balanced | All training types | Normal performance |
| -20 to -10 | Slightly fatigued | Easy to moderate intensity | Slightly reduced |
| -30 to -20 | Fatigued | Easy training, recovery focus | Reduced performance |
| < -30 | Very fatigued | Recovery essential | Poor performance |

#### Practical Applications

**Training Planning:**
```
TSB-based training prescription:
- TSB +20: Time for breakthrough workout
- TSB +10: Quality intervals, testing
- TSB 0: Normal training load
- TSB -10: Reduce intensity, maintain volume
- TSB -20: Easy training only
- TSB -30: Rest day or very easy
```

**Competition Timing:**
- Target TSB +5 to +15 for key events
- Allow 5-10 days for TSB to rise
- Balance freshness with fitness loss

## Multi-Sport Considerations

### Sport-Specific Scaling

Different sports impose varying stress on the body:

**Stress Multipliers:**
- Cycling: 1.0 (baseline)
- Running: 1.3-1.5 (higher impact)
- Swimming: 0.8-1.0 (lower overall stress)

### Combined Load Analysis

**Load Distribution by Sport:**
```
Weekly TSS example:
- Cycling: 600 TSS (60%)
- Running: 300 TSS (30%)
- Swimming: 100 TSS (10%)
Total: 1000 TSS
```

**Recovery Considerations:**
- Running requires more recovery time
- Swimming provides active recovery
- Cycling allows higher volume

## Practical Training Applications

### Weekly Planning

**Microcycle Structure:**
```
Monday: Recovery (TSB check)
Tuesday: Quality work (if TSB > -10)
Wednesday: Endurance/tempo
Thursday: Quality work or recovery
Friday: Easy/recovery
Saturday: Long endurance or race
Sunday: Easy endurance
```

### Monthly Planning

**Mesocycle Progression:**
- Week 1: Build (CTL +5)
- Week 2: Build (CTL +3)
- Week 3: Build (CTL +2)
- Week 4: Recovery (CTL -2)

### Seasonal Planning

**Macrocycle Structure:**
1. **Base Phase**: Build CTL steadily (40-70)
2. **Build Phase**: Increase intensity (CTL 70-90)
3. **Peak Phase**: Reduce volume, maintain intensity
4. **Recovery Phase**: Active recovery (CTL -20%)

## Warning Signs & Red Flags
