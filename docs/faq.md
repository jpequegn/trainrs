## Training Metrics

### How accurate are the TSS calculations?

TrainRS implements the original TSS algorithm as published by Dr. Andy Coggan with several accuracy improvements:

**Accuracy Features:**
- **Decimal arithmetic**: Prevents floating-point errors
- **Validated algorithms**: Match published formulas exactly
- **Quality checks**: Data validation and outlier detection
- **Sport-specific**: Adaptations for cycling, running, swimming

**Validation Methods:**
- Compared against reference implementations
- Tested with known workout data
- Validated by sports scientists
- Extensive unit testing

### Why are my TSS values different from other platforms?

Common reasons for TSS differences:

1. **Threshold Settings**: Different FTP/LTHR values
2. **Data Quality**: Power spikes, dropouts, or smoothing
3. **Algorithm Variants**: Some platforms use modified formulas
4. **Rounding Differences**: TrainRS uses higher precision
5. **Sport Adaptations**: Different scaling factors

**To check:**
```bash
# Verify your thresholds
trainrs zones --show

# Check workout data quality
trainrs display --workouts --detailed

# Compare raw vs processed data
trainrs export --include-raw --format json
```

### What's the difference between average power and normalized power?

**Average Power**: Simple arithmetic mean of all power values
**Normalized Power (NP)**: Physiologically-adjusted power accounting for:
- Variability in intensity
- Non-linear stress response
- 30-second physiological lag time

**When they differ:**
- **NP > Average**: Variable intensity (intervals, group rides)
- **NP â‰ˆ Average**: Steady-state efforts (time trials)
- **High difference**: Poor pacing or very variable efforts

### How do I interpret PMC values?

**PMC Components:**
- **CTL (Fitness)**: 42-day exponentially weighted average
- **ATL (Fatigue)**: 7-day exponentially weighted average
- **TSB (Form)**: CTL - ATL, indicates readiness

**Typical Values:**
```
Recreational athlete: CTL 40-60
Competitive amateur: CTL 60-80
Elite athlete: CTL 80-120+
```

**TSB Interpretation:**
- **+20**: Very fresh, peak performance possible
- **+10**: Fresh, ready for hard training
- **0**: Balanced, normal training
- **-10**: Slightly fatigued, reduce intensity
- **-20**: Fatigued, easy training only
- **-30**: Very fatigued, rest needed
```

See the [Training Load Guide](training-load.md) for detailed interpretation.

## Multi-Sport Training

### How does TrainRS handle different sports?

TrainRS applies sport-specific scaling factors and calculations:

**Sport Scaling Factors:**
- **Cycling**: 1.0 (baseline)
- **Running**: 1.3-1.5 (higher impact stress)
- **Swimming**: 0.8-1.0 (lower overall stress)

**Sport-Specific Metrics:**
- **Cycling**: Power-based TSS, IF, NP
- **Running**: Pace-based TSS, GAP, elevation adjustments
- **Swimming**: Time-based TSS, stroke rate analysis

### Can I combine training loads from different sports?

Yes! TrainRS provides several approaches:

**Combined Load Analysis:**
```bash
trainrs multi-sport --combined-load --days 30
```

**Sport-Specific Breakdown:**
```bash
trainrs multi-sport --sport-breakdown --days 30
```

**Weighted Combination:**
```bash
trainrs multi-sport --weights cycling:1.0,running:1.3,swimming:0.9
```

### How do I set up zones for multiple sports?

Configure zones for each sport separately:

```bash
# Cycling power zones
trainrs zones --sport cycling --set-ftp 250

# Running pace zones
trainrs zones --sport running --set-threshold-pace 4:00

# Swimming zones (time-based)
trainrs zones --sport swimming --set-css-pace 1:20
```

## Configuration & Customization

### How do I manage multiple athlete profiles?

**Create Athletes:**

trainrs athlete --create --name "John Doe" --id john_doe
trainrs athlete --create --name "Jane Smith" --id jane_smith
```

**Switch Between Athletes:**
```bash
# Use specific athlete for command
trainrs calculate --athlete john_doe --days 30

# Set default athlete
trainrs config --set athlete.default=john_doe

# List all athletes
trainrs athlete --list
```

### Can I customize the calculation algorithms?

TrainRS allows several customizations:

**PMC Time Constants:**
```bash
# Custom CTL period (default: 42 days)
trainrs pmc --ctl-days 45

# Custom ATL period (default: 7 days)
trainrs pmc --atl-days 5
```

**Zone Calculation Methods:**
```bash
# Heart rate zones from LTHR vs Max HR
trainrs zones --method lthr
trainrs zones --method max-hr
```

**Smoothing and Filtering:**
```bash
# Power data smoothing
trainrs calculate --smooth-power --window 30

# Outlier filtering
trainrs import --filter-outliers --max-power 1500
```

### How do I automate TrainRS with scripts?

TrainRS is designed for automation:

**Bash Script Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily training analysis script

# Import today's data
trainrs import --file today_workout.csv

# Calculate metrics
trainrs calculate --days 1

# Generate summary
trainrs summary --type daily --output daily_summary.txt

# Check if rest day needed
TSB=$(trainrs display --format json | jq '.tsb')
if (( $(echo "$TSB < -20" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "Rest day recommended (TSB: $TSB)"
fi
```

**Python Integration:**
```python
import subprocess
import json

# Run TrainRS and parse output
result = subprocess.run(['trainrs', 'display', '--format', 'json'],
                       capture_output=True, text=True)
data = json.loads(result.stdout)

# Analyze data
ctl = data['ctl']
atl = data['atl']
tsb = data['tsb']

print(f"Fitness: {ctl}, Fatigue: {atl}, Form: {tsb}")
```

## Performance & Optimization

2. **Spikes**: Check for electromagnetic interference
3. **Dropouts**: Verify battery and connectivity
4. **Scaling**: Some devices report kW instead of W

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```bash
# Check for outliers
trainrs display --workouts --detailed | grep max_power

# View power distribution
trainrs power --distribution --days 30

# Filter obvious errors
trainrs import --file data.csv --filter-spikes --max-power 1500
```

### TrainRS says my FTP is too low/high. How do I set it correctly?

**FTP Testing Methods:**

1. **20-minute test**: FTP = 95% of 20-min average power
2. **60-minute test**: FTP = average power for 1 hour
3. **Ramp test**: Use platform-specific protocols
4. **Analysis-based**: TrainRS can estimate from training data

**Setting FTP:**
```bash
# Manual setting
trainrs zones --sport cycling --set-ftp 250

# Auto-detection from data
trainrs zones --auto-detect --days 90

# Gradual adjustment
trainrs zones --adjust-ftp +5  # Increase by 5W
```

### How do I know if my training zones are correct?

**Zone Validation Methods:**

1. **Physiological testing**: Lab testing for accurate thresholds
2. **Field testing**: Time trials at different durations
3. **Training analysis**: Review zone distribution over time
4. **Perceived exertion**: Match zones to RPE scales
